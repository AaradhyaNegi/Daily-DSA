Problem statement
You are given a string denoting a valid Postfix expression containing ‘+’, ’-’, ’*’, ‘/’ and lowercase letters.



Convert the given Postfix expression into a Prefix expression.



Note:
Postfix notation is a method of writing mathematical expressions in which operators are placed after the operands. For example, "a b +" represents the addition of a and b.

Prefix notation is a method of writing mathematical expressions in which operators are placed before the operands. For example, "+ a b" represents the addition of a and b.

Expression contains lowercase English letters, ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, and  ‘/’. 


Example:
Input: abc*+

Output: +a*bc

Explanation:
For the given postfix expression, infix expression is a+b*c. And it's corresponding prefix expression is +a*bc.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
ab+cd-*


Expected Answer:
*+ab-cd 


Output on console:
*+ab-cd 


Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
For this testcase, the infix expression will be (a + b) * (c - d). Hence, our prefix expression will be *+ab-cd.


Sample Input 2:
ab+c-


Expected Answer:
-+abc


Output on console:
-+abc


Expected Time Complexity:
Try to solve this in O(n), where n is the length of expression.    


Constraints:
1 <= |s| <= 10^5

Time Limit: 1 sec

        Stack<String> s = new Stack<>();

        for(int i=0; i<exp.length(); i++){
            char c = exp.charAt(i);
            if(c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '/' || c == '*'){
                String pop1 = s.pop();
                String pop2 = s.pop();
                s.push(c+pop2+pop1);
            }else{
                s.push(c+"");
            }
        }
        return s.pop();
    }
}
